# Hello World

This is a very long line of text for testing purposes and it needs to be
around 300 characters long to see how the linter handles it, so I will
just keep on writing until I reach that approximate length, and I'll add
some more dummy text to make sure it is really, really, really long
enough to satisfy the testing requirements.
Here is another sentence, and this one is also going to be exceptionally
long, just to make sure that we have plenty of text to work with when we
are testing the line-length capabilities of whatever tool we happen to be
using, so I'm just going to keep typing for a little while longer.
This is the third long string of text that I am adding to this file, and it
is also going to be very long, because the user asked for two more long
strings, and I want to make sure that I am fulfilling the request as
accurately as possible, so I will just keep on writing for a bit longer.
And here is the fourth and final long string of text, which I am adding to
this file to make sure that there is plenty of content for testing the
line-length limits of the linter, and I think that this should probably be
enough text to get the job done, so I will stop writing now.
